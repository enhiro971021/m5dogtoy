# Audio Assets

Place the following audio files in this directory so the Processing sketch can load them:

- `run_step.wav` — short, punchy footfall hit.
- `shake_hit.wav` — bright jingle or collar rattle accent.
- `running_loop.wav` — low, continuous layer for trotting/running.
- `idle_pad.wav` — subtle ambient pad for idle/standing.
- `shake_loop.wav` — sustained rattle loop for high-energy shaking.

All files should be mono or stereo WAV/AIFF. Adjust the filenames in `processing/DogToyBallSound.pde` if you prefer different names.
